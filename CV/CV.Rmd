# About me

I use novel sampling methods, computers and large genetic datasets to answer biological questions, typically in marine vertebrates. My research has focused on the development and deployment of a novel sampler capable of simultaneously collecting environmental DNA (eDNA), stereo-video imagery and oceanographic data, investigating  the spatial distribution of marine vertebrate species in the context of anthropogenic change; especially the presence of restricted-access marine areas such as Marine Parks and offshore infrastructure. I am particularly passionate about the development of novel software tools to standardise and automate the analysis, reporting and display of ecological data, particularly eDNA metabarcoding data.
